            <h2>Featured Article: GameStop Is Running Out of Lives</h2><hr>
            
            <p>As gaming enthusiasts steadily shift to the virtual consumption of video games, investors become increasingly dubious of GameStop’s business model. The notable acceleration in digital sales has helped facilitate a gradual decline in in-store sales and has prompted investors to wonder if the video game retailer will suffer a fate similar to companies like Blockbuster and RadioShack. A research firm known as NPD Group warned investors of the company’s disappointing retail game sales earlier this month. Shares of GameStop's stock fell 12% on the day NPD’s report was released. Despite this seemingly inauspicious trend, the company’s share price has risen approximately 16% this year. Its shares fetch less than nine times forward earnings, but GameStop has been buying back stock to reward shareholders and, conceivably, to burn short sellers. </p> <br>

            <p>Revenue generated by GameStop’s resale business has immensely contributed to its ability to remain profitable. When customers sell old merchandise back to GameStop for store credit, GameStop profits by reselling the merchandise for higher prices. The margins associated with this particular revenue source are considerably better than those yielded by new video game sales. The company has also expanded into mobile markets—smartphones, tablets, etc.—to accommodate prevailing market trends. However, such markets represent only a small portion of GameStop’s total revenue. </p> <br>

            <p>The impending obsolescence of GameStop’s business model has prompted investors to bet heavily against its stock as the holiday season approaches. Short interest, or securities borrowed by investors who hope to gain from a decline in a stock’s share price, has reached an astounding 45% of shares outstanding and may continue to grow if sentiment for the stock continues to diminish. Perhaps the staying power for which GameStop has become known will once again substantiate the notion that it has at least a few more lives left. </p> <hr>
